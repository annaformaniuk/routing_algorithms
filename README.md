# routing_algorithms

This repository is a part of a students' project aimed to analyse how accurately routes generated by algorithms represent paths people who know the neighbourhood take when walking from one point to the other. For this, two kinds of routes can be generated: 
 - the shortest path (Dijkstra)
 - the shortest path (Dijkstra), where the costs of moving from one node to the other is reduced according to the amount and importance of landmarks located on the corresponding streets. 
The study area of the project is the Kreuzviertel part of the city of MÃ¼nster (NRW, Germany), thus the network is created based on nodes and edges that belong to it. Currently, only four locations are foreseen as console inputs for route generation (rewe, brewery, theater, edeka), but other coordinates can easily be added.
